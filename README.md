# Code-of-the-Eternal-Guardian-Echoes-of-Equilibrium
"Code of the Eternal Guardian: Echoes of Equilibrium" is a Python simulation symbolizing the struggle against systemic abuse. Hackers (activists) challenge the RCMP (system) in an infinite chess-like battle, reflecting the relentless pursuit of justice for vulnerable communities in Canada. A digital tribute to tireless activism and hope.
